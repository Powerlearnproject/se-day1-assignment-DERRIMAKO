#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It involves using structured methodologies, tools, and best practices to create reliable, scalable, and efficient software solutions.
Importance in the Technology Industry:
Ensures High-Quality Software: Software engineering focuses on developing robust, efficient, and maintainable software that meets user requirements.
Improves Efficiency and Productivity: By following structured development processes, teams can work more effectively, reducing development time and effort.
Enhances Scalability and Maintainability: Proper engineering principles ensure that software can evolve and scale as business needs grow.
Reduces Costs and Risks: Systematic planning, testing, and maintenance minimize software defects, reducing long-term costs and potential failures.
Drives Innovation: Software engineering enables the development of cutting-edge technologies, from AI to cloud computing, shaping the modern digital world.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s-1960s – Birth of Software Engineering: The term "software engineering" emerged to address the software crisis, emphasizing structured programming and disciplined development.
1970s-1980s – Introduction of Software Development Models: The Waterfall model and Agile methodologies were introduced, improving project management and efficiency.
1990s-Present – Rise of Modern Software Engineering: The adoption of DevOps, cloud computing, and AI-driven development revolutionized software engineering, enhancing automation, scalability, and collaboration.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Define project scope, objectives, and feasibility to ensure successful development.
Requirement Analysis: Gather and document user and system requirements.
Design: Create software architecture, UI/UX, and system models based on requirements.
Implementation (Coding): Develop the software using programming languages and frameworks.
Testing: Identify and fix bugs through unit, integration, and system testing.
Deployment: Release the software for users, either as a full launch or in phases.
Maintenance: Provide updates, bug fixes, and improvements based on user feedback.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
there is Low flexibility,changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
Testing is done at the end of the development process. 
agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes, tests, and maintains code, ensuring functionality and performance.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests software to find bugs, ensure compliance with standards, and validate user requirements.
Project Manager: Oversees project planning, ensures deadlines are met, and manages team coordination.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS): Manage code changes, collaboration, and rollback (e.g., Git, GitHub).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines: Use Agile methodologies, prioritize tasks, and automate processes.
Bug Fixing & Debugging: Implement thorough testing, use debugging tools, and write clean code.
Changing Requirements: Adopt Agile development and maintain clear communication with stakeholders.
Security Risks: Follow best practices, conduct regular security audits, and use encryption.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components to ensure they work correctly.
Integration Testing: Checks how different modules interact.
System Testing: Validates the entire system’s functionality.
Acceptance Testing: Ensures the software meets user needs before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing clear and effective inputs (prompts) to optimize responses from AI models. It ensures that AI generates relevant, accurate, and high-quality outputs.
Enhances AI Accuracy: Well-structured prompts reduce ambiguity and improve response precision.
Saves Time: Clear prompts lead to faster and more relevant answers.
Improves AI Usability: Helps users interact more effectively with AI, making it a powerful tool for various applications.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me about cars.
Improved Prompt: Explain the differences between electric and ICE cars, including cost, performance, and environmental impact.
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
More Specific: It focuses on a comparison rather than a broad topic.
Clear Expectations: It defines key aspects (cost, performance, environment).
Concise & Direct: Avoids unnecessary words while guiding AI toward the desired response.
